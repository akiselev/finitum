# Finitum status

Updated: 2026-08-21
Milestone: FC9 advanced realization reference contracts complete

## Implemented

- validated 1D--3D simplex meshes with finite coordinates, bounded connectivity, and distinct
  vertices per cell;
- deterministic global degree-of-freedom maps with nonempty, bounded, duplicate-free element
  restrictions;
- explicit affine constraints with unique targets/dependencies, finite coefficients, bounds and
  cycle validation, exact input extents, and finite expansion results;
- prepared quadrature/basis tables with checked extents, shape validation, and finite data;
- P1 simplex reference basis and barycenter quadrature preparation;
- digest validation across Resolvent `FormRequirements`/`OperatorFactorization` and complete
  Malleus primal/JVP/VJP/parameter bundles;
- concrete affine geometry preprocessing and quadrature-point external-input packing;
- deterministic gather, value/gradient basis forward action, generated primal/JVP execution,
  quadrature weighting, basis transpose, and scatter;
- affine constraint prolongation, transpose restriction, lifting, and explicit constraint rows for
  both residual and directional actions, including nested hanging-node dependencies;
- one `RealizationPlan` producing matrix-free and canonical CSR assembled operators through the
  same generated JVP execution; both implement Solverang `LinearOperator` directly.
- independent runtime state and state-rate basis bindings for generated primal residuals;
- generated JVP evaluation at the actual linearization point, with independent state/rate
  directions;
- dynamic quadrature-point external inputs and chain-rule composition through generated
  parameter-JVP kernels;
- fixed essential residual rows and their consistent state-direction JVP rows.
- deterministic concrete-plan identity covering the artifact chain, mesh, element, DOF map,
  constraints, stored external values, and caller-declared dynamic-input identities.
- product-space block layouts with explicit field/entity/component ownership and deterministic
  gather/scatter;
- deterministic simplex exterior/interior facet topology, explicit reversible minus/plus
  interface ordering, and cell-to-facet orientation signs;
- affine H(curl) covariant and H(div) contravariant Piola maps, oriented edge/facet DOF
  restrictions, and triangle/tetrahedron incidence complexes that verify curl-grad and div-curl
  are exactly zero;
- element-local Schur condensation with a retained trace system and full interior recovery map;
- `SystemRealizationPlan`, which validates Resolvent block coordinates and the complete
  form/factorization/Malleus receipt chain before digest-binding it to a mesh, block layout,
  facets, compatible maps, and exact-sequence evidence.
- one-dimensional nonmatching Lagrange transfer and mortar-like common-trace interpolation with
  weighted conservative transpose scatter;
- per-cell hp segment elements with Gauss-Legendre quadrature and explicit linear hanging-node
  constraints;
- quadrature-point partial assembly preserving `E^T B^T D B E`, separate dense element assembly,
  fixed-width cell batches, component/lane accelerator packing, and tensor-product
  sum-factorized value/gradient evaluation; and
- an explicit level-set identity and quadrature policy for linearly clipped segment cells.

## Boundary

Resolvent owns the abstract space and form meaning. Malleus owns executable local kernels.
Finitum owns their concrete mesh/space binding and global realization. Krasis owns coupled
state and Solverang owns numerical algorithms.

The manifest now depends directly on Resolvent, Malleus, and Solverang because realization plans
consume their concrete artifacts and trait. The FC6/FC7 executable action remains scalar
H1(order=1) cell integration. FC8 adds deterministic mixed, facet, Piola, exact-sequence, and
condensation reference contracts. FC9 adds reference transfer, hp, affine-constraint, partial,
batched, packed, sum-factorized, and clipped-segment paths without claiming a production SIMD/GPU
backend, general multidimensional hp meshes, or embedded-domain source semantics.

The FC6 linear operator continues to evaluate generated JVPs at zero active input. FC7 callers use
the explicit residual and state/rate JVP actions at a runtime linearization point. Concrete
constrained DOFs and their values are caller-supplied: Finitum verifies that semantic and concrete
constraints are both present and that
their extents are valid, but the mesh has no boundary-region tags with which to prove partition
membership. Point-kernel buffers are allocated per invocation, external sampling prepares its
own cell geometry, and reference CSR assembly performs one operator action per column; these are
deliberate fixture-grade costs, not production performance claims.

## Validation

Passed on 2026-08-21 with Rust 1.97.0:

```text
cargo fmt --check
cargo check --all-targets
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets           # 21 passed, 0 failed
git diff --check
```

The realization gate includes an independent affine patch test on a nonuniform sheared mesh:
with `k = 1`, `f = 0`, and nonzero linear Dirichlet data, both realized operators reproduce every
exact P1 nodal value within `1e-12`.

The FC7 gate compiles a transient nonlinear form and verifies the combined generated state/rate
and dynamic-property JVP against centered differences.

The FC8 gate independently checks vector/tensor block ownership, a Stokes-like Schur complement
against the uncondensed local residual, H(div) flux preservation and shared-facet signs, a
conservative two-sided DG facet scatter, H(curl) circulation preservation, and exact simplex
incidence identities.

The FC9 gate checks nonmatching mortar work conservation, hp partition/gradient identities,
hanging-node prolongation and constraint rows, dense-reference sum factorization, accelerator
pack/unpack identity, exact clipped polynomial integration, and quadrature-partial JVP agreement
with generated Malleus interpreter execution and centered differences.

## Next

Extend these contracts to production multidimensional hp/embedded meshes or target code only from
a concrete acceptance case; keep point-QFunction meaning and backend numerical policy explicit.
